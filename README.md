- 👋 Hi, I’m @Trustyowl
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, anime, manga, photography, and drawing 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C#, C++

- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite hobby is photography—I love capturing moments and telling stories through images. If I could go anywhere, I'd probably choose Japan. The blend of tradition and modernity fascinates me, plus I'm a big fan of anime and manga.
